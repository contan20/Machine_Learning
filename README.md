# Machine Learning challenge: Prediction of Missing Bid-Ask Spread Quotes
Challenge organised by Ecole Normale Superieure, in collaboration with Capital Fund Management.

We build a machine learning pipeline to predict some missing values of bid-ask spreads, from a real dataset supplied by CFM. We implement some features engineering techniques to increase data quality. We test different ML algorithms including XGBoost, Random Forest, Neural Networks. We proceed to parametrization of XGBoost. We find out that a linear combination of XGBoost and Random Forest returns the lowest Root Mean Square Logarithmic Error.
